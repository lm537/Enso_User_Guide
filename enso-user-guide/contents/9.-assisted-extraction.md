# 9. Assisted Extraction

·  A new object – Document class – has been introduced in Enso.

·  Doc class has the following properties:

o        Any document being processed must belong to one document class.

o        Each document class is linked to a domain object.

o         Each solution comes with a default doc class, linked to ‘unknown’  domain object .

o          A single domain object can have multiple doc classes. For example, for a resume domain object, you may create doc classes for  linkedin resume and  monster resume , to extract information from varying formats.

o           At document classification, the platform classifies the document as one of the doc classes.

o           Doc classes are of two types,

                       unstructured doc class – it has its own set of extraction                              models\( heading, key value , paragraph\)

                        structured doc class – user needs to create a template before usage.

· User can do the following training on doc classes:

o           **Document classification training:** provide sample of documents to improve identification of doc class at document classification step in processing.

o           **Assisted extraction:** provide annotated data for training, this feature retrains the extraction models linked to the doc class, and improve extraction quality. Elements that can be improved this way are: key value, heading and paragraph.

o            **Assisted linking:**provide annotations to improve entity linking step for the doc class.

1.   Import the Domain Object .json file or create New Domain Object. Here we import the domain object file.

2. Click on Browse and select the file and click on Import.

3. After the file is imported, the domain objects will be displayed as shown below.

4. Once the domain object is created a default document class with that domain object name appending to it will be created in the unstructured document class section.

5. Click on that document class. A window as shown below appears.

6. Click on Document Classification to classify the documents type\(ex: invoices, resume, etc\). Click on Browse to upload the zip folder containing the list of documents and click on Proceed.

7. A screen as shown below appears.

9. Click on “What would you like to do again” and select Assisted Extraction.

10. Click on Browse and upload the zip file containing the folders which have the  document and the .json file in each folder and click on Proceed.                  

 Note: The training index is an optional value which can be between 1-100 which is used to override the already trained model with the new values.

11. A screen as shown below appears.

12. Refresh the page after sometime and a screen with trained models appear as shown below.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

13. Once the models are trained, go to Model Studio and select any model of that particular document class.

14. The versions of the model before and after training appear as shown below. Select the high accuracy version and make it default.

15. Go to Sources and select on ingest file and upload the document.

16. Select the pipeline to be used and click on Upload.
