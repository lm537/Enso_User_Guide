# 5.2 Git Enablement/Integration

·       GIT enables the developers to have a version control so that any changes made to the code can be pulled using pull request and if the code works perfect, it can be committed.

·       Enabling GIT in the ENSO platform makes it easier to pull the functions required in the pipeline from the GIT repository, and any changes made to the functions in the GIT environment, can be easily obtained by clicking on “Fetch Latest” in the ENSO platform.

·       ENSO supports projects built in GIT Lab, GIT Hub and Bit Bucket.
