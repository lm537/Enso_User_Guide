# 5.1 Importing Functions from Jupyter Notebook

1.  Go to the function tab and click on the “New Function”. Enter all the necessary details such as function name, type of function, description, and version details. A jupyter notebook will be opened after a new function is created.

2. Need of custom functions: 

a. Pre-processing \(used before ML model\)

For every solutions, model are trained with different dataset. Hence, in real time application when the data is captured from text extraction or from different sources, it needs to be brought to a format that is acceptable by ML model. Hence, a pre-processing custom function may be required to bring the data to a form similar to the dataset that were used to train the model.

For example, in the screenshot given below, the gender of patients were extracted as “Male” and “Female” and hence, a custom function \(pre-processing\) was written to convert the gender of patient to 1 and 0.

b. Post-processing \(used after ML model\).

The output of the ML model should be tagged to the respective entity and attribute defined in the domain object. Hence, post processing function is required to perform this task.

The above screenshot shows a custom function \(post processing\) that defines the result if the probability scores of ML model reaches a threshold value. Then it also maps the result with the required attributes.

  3. Enable and Publish the Function: 

a. After the function is written, click on save jupyter notebook to save the function. Once the function is saved, publish and enable the function. If a function has multiple versions, then enable and mark the required version as default. Please note that function needs to be enabled separately along with version.

4.Modify a function:

a. Function can’t be modified in the published version. Any modification in the function can be done by creating a new version. Click on the edit option in a published version. Fill the version name and details and submit. Now, after modification of code in jupyter notebook, the function needs to be saved and published. After a modified function gets published, it has to be enabled and should be set as default.
