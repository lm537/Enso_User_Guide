# 2.2.1 Using Enso Inbuilt ML Tools

1.              Go the model studio

2.              Click the New model \(A new model can also be created in a different model group. To create a new model group, please click on the new model group tab and fill the necessary details\). Once, the  new model group is created , new model can be created inside that model group using new model tab

3. Enter all the model details and create the model.

4. Integrate ML tasks into the new model:

a. Load Dataset :This services will prompt for dataset to be used during training and evaluate model. Drag and drop ML task onto the screen. In the right-hand side, type load dataset in the “Services” field.

b. Inbuilt Machine Learning Algorithms: This services train and evaluate ML Model.

c. Drag and drop ML task onto the screen. Then click on the ML task and type “SKL” in the “Services” field \(on the right-hand side of the screen\) to see all the list of available machine learning algorithms. Select a required ML algorithm. Once the ML algorithm selection is completed, the value should be given to the parameters/hyperparameters on the right hand side\( in the service task\)

Please note that target column name \(in the service task\) should be same as the target column name present in the dataset. Here, target column name refers to dependent variable column name in the dataset.

d. Connect the services and complete the pipeline.

5. Train and Evaluate the Model:

After the ML model pipeline is complete, click on the train model tab. Select the required dataset and train the model. Once the training is completed, Evaluate the model with required dataset by clicking on “evaluate tab”

6. Publish the model:

Once the training and evaluation is completed, click on the “publish” tab.

7. Enable the correct version and model :

If more than one version is created for a model, then mark the required version as default and enable the model. Please note that a model needs to be enabled along with required version.
