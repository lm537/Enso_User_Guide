# 2.2.2 Using Pickle File

1.  Go to model resource in Dataset. Click on New Model Resource and upload pickle file.

2. Create a ML function: Go the function tab. Click on New Function and select the function type as ML. Once the function type is highlighted correctly, select the dataset, binary file \(pickle file\) from drop ‘n’ down menu. Click on proceed to create a ML function.

3. Modify ML Function

a. Once ML function is created a default set of code will be visible in the Jupyter Notebook. If an already trained model in the form of pickle file is used, then the train model function needs to be deleted from the default ML code.

b. In the run and evaluate function \(within default ML Function\), the pickle file name, target column name needs to be changed.Target column name should be same as the dependent variable column name in the dataset. The reqiuired field that needs to be changed is highlighted in the screenshot given below.

c. After the modification is done, click on save Jupyter Notebook to save the function. Once the function is saved, publish and enable the function. If a function has multiple versions, then enable and mark the required version as default. Please note that function needs to be enabled separately along with version.

d. Go to the Model Studio. Click the New model \(A new model can also be created in a different model group. To create a new model group, please click on the new model group tab and fill the necessary details\) . Once, the new model group is created, new model can be created inside that model group using new model tab\)

4. Enter all the model details.

5. Integrate ML tasks and custom task into the the ML model pipeline:

a. Load Dataset: This service will prompt for dataset to be used during training and evaluating model.

b. Drag and drop ML task onto the screen. In the right-hand side, type “load dataset” in the “Services” field.

c. Integrate Custom ML task\(function\) to the pipeline:

d. Drag and drop task onto the screen and  select the required  ML function from the drop-down menu under the field “function” \(as shown in the screenshot mentioned above\)

e. Connect the services and complete the pipeline

6. Train and Evaluate the Model:

a. After the ML model pipeline is complete, click on the train model tab. Select the required dataset and train the model. After the training is completed, Evaluate the model with required dataset.

7. Publish the model:

a. Once the training and evaluation is completed, click on the “publish” tab

8. Enable the required version and model :

a. If more than one version is created for a model, then mark the required version as default and enable the model. Please note that a model needs to be enabled along with required version.
