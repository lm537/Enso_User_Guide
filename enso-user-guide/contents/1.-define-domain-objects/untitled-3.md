4.  Define the entity by clicking “+” in domain object. Once the new entity is created, the properties field in the right-hand side of the page needs to be filled. The properties for the entity have fields such as:

·       Name: The entity name should be defined

·       Data type: Entity

·       Entity: Create

·       Cardinality: 1 or n

·       Synonyms\(optional\): Other most common names used for entity

·       Ontology\(optional\):  ontology \(.owl\) file\(if any\) should be uploaded by clicking on  “link an ontology” . After clicking “link ontology”, required ontology needs to be selected from drop down menu. Please note that, the ontology will be visible in drop down list only when it is uploaded in the vocabulary section. To do that open the vocabulary tab. Click on “ontology” and then upload the ontology file. Once the file is uploaded, we can go to the entity and link the ontology from drop down list. Please ensure the attribute under the entity should have synonyms for the ontology fields.

Once the entity is created, it needs to be saved.
